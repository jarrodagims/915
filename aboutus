<h1>When it Comes to Investing in Real Estate, Choose the Best Option That’s Out There — Choose Zia Homes</h1>

Real estate is no joke. The process of investing in a piece of land is both exciting and daunting all at once. Everything from choosing a home builder to finding the right lender and the twists and turns of making one decision after another. But when you finally arrive at that finish line and the keys of your new home are handed over to you, you can take a deep breath and be at peace knowing the best part of your journey is now underway. 

When you invest in real estate, it’s important to know who you’re working with. Their values should reflect the type of principles you wish to see in a builder. It’s important to feel secure working with your home builder as you’ll be communicating with them for months to come. At Zia Homes, we use every conversation as an opportunity to build a foundation of trust and credibility. We’re interested in your real estate goals and it is our mission to bring them to life!

<h2>Our Company’s History</h2>


Zia Homes’ story begins in 1985 when Ronald Costa began building roughly ten homes per year. As a small home builder in the 80s’, Costa played a role in El Paso’s residential growth. His vision and determination to create affordable, quality homes quickly grew to 100 homes per year. 

Today, Zia Homes builds with the modern family in mind. As a family-friendly home builder, we take into account the needs of all types, sizes, and age groups of families. We make our homes affordable so that new families can begin an exciting chapter with the ability to build memories in the kitchen, backyard, gathering room, bedroom, and beyond!

<h2>About Zia Homes’ Quality Assurance [SECTION TAKEN FROM SITE]</h2>

At Zia Homes, we pride ourselves in building a quality home from the ground up. We take great lengths to ensure every house built has passed a three-phase quality assurance process. The inspections are conducted by a licensed real estate inspector who is responsible for providing us with a written report of each inspection. The field superintendents use this report to correct any defects prior to delivering the house to the buyers.

Below are the three inspections that are conducted on every house:

Pre-Slab Inspection. This initial phase will ensure that the house is squared and is placed correctly on the property.
Pre-Roof Inspection. In this next step, we ensure that the framing and the prep work on the roof are done correctly before the roof is installed.
Pre-Walk Through Inspection. During this final phase of inspection, we will ensure that the house has been detailed and is ready for the buyer’s New Home Orientation.
