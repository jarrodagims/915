                    <h3>Trial Consultant Ready to Help You</h3>

                    <p class="blurb">Jonathan Leach, LLC, is a trial consulting firm that helps attorneys, parties, clients, and witnesses present the best case possible. We are not a law firm. Instead we seek to enhance the practice of law by strengthening the skills of the legal practitioner. We do so by providing insights and information about litigation-related behavior and communication. We are based in El Paso, but our clients and cases are located throughout the United States.</p>

                    <p>Whether you need jury consulting, jury research, witness training, or trial graphics, we tailor our services to your particular circumstances in order to help you feel more confident, more prepared, and more knowledgeable as your case goes forward.</p></div>

                        <p class="blurb">Although as jury consultants we are most often retained by the attorney in a given case, we are also commonly contacted directly by the client or by an insurer. Once we join the team, we then use our insights and expertise to help our clients understand and address the nonlegal or extralegal factors that are likely to affect the case.</p>
                        <p>
                        Our primary focus is on effective communications. We work with our clients to develop strategies for presenting the strongest possible case to a judge, a jury, an arbitrator, or a mediator. We bring more than 20 years of experience to this work. We are long-standing members of our professional society, the American Society of Trial Consultants (ASTC).</p></div>

                    <h2>Working With a Trial Consultant </h2>

                    <p>Contacting us early is key. The best time to begin consultation is early enough to adjust trial preparations, and make course corrections, as the case moves forward. Typically we get involved before discovery is underway. That is because, once a critical witness had been deposed, it can be difficult to “unring the bell” of  the transcribed testimony and its ultimate influence on the jury. Virtually all of the tools offered by a trial consulting firm--jury research, theming, graphics development, witness training, and so on--are most effective when deployed well in advance of the target event.  Adjustments to and fine-tuning of the case become possible when there is still time to do so.</p>
