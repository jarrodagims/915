                    <p>Contacting us early is key. The best time to begin consultation is early enough to adjust trial preparations, and make course corrections, as the case moves forward. Typically we get involved before discovery is underway. That is because, once a critical witness had been deposed, it can be difficult to “unring the bell” of  the transcribed testimony and its ultimate influence on the jury. Virtually all of the tools offered by a trial consulting firm--jury research, theming, graphics development, witness training, and so on--are most effective when deployed well in advance of the target event.  Adjustments to and fine-tuning of the case become possible when there is still time to do so.</p></div>
