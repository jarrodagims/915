                            <p>At Zia Homes, we pride ourselves in building a quality home from the ground up. We take
                                great lengths to ensure every house built has passed a three-phase quality assurance
                                process. The inspections are conducted by a licensed real estate inspector who is
                                responsible for providing us with a written report of each inspection. The field
                                superintendents use this report to correct any defects prior to delivering the house to
                                the buyers.</p>

                                        Pre-Slab Inspection. This initial phase will ensure that the house is squared

                                        placed correctly on the property.
