                                    Choose Zia Homes</h1>
                                <p>Real estate is no joke. The process of investing in a piece of land is both exciting
                                    and daunting all at once. Everything from choosing a home builder to finding the
                                    right lender and the twists and turns of making one decision after another. But when
                                    you finally arrive at that finish line and the keys of your new home are handed over
                                    to you, you can take a deep breath and be at peace knowing the best part of your
                                    journey is now underway.</p>
                                <p>When you invest in real estate, it’s important to know who you’re working with. Their
                                    values should reflect the type of principles you wish to see in a builder. It’s
                                    important to feel secure working with your home builder as you’ll be communicating
                                    with them for months to come. At Zia Homes, we use every conversation as an
                                    opportunity to build a foundation of trust and credibility. We’re interested in your
                                    real estate goals and it is our mission to bring them to life!</p>
                                <h2>Our Company’s History</h2>
                                <p>Zia Homes’ story begins in 1985 when Ronald Costa began building roughly ten homes
                                    per year. As a small home builder in the 80s’, Costa played a role in El Paso’s
                                    residential growth. His vision and determination to create affordable, quality homes
                                    quickly grew to 100 homes per year.</p>
                                <p>Today, Zia Homes builds with the modern family in mind. As a family-friendly home
                                    builder, we take into account the needs of all types, sizes, and age groups of
                                    families. We make our homes affordable so that new families can begin an exciting
                                    chapter with the ability to build memories in the kitchen, backyard, gathering room,
                                    bedroom, and beyond!</p>

                            <p>At Zia Homes, we pride ourselves in building a quality home from the ground up. We take
                                great lengths to ensure every house built has passed a three-phase quality assurance
                                process. The inspections are conducted by a licensed real estate inspector who is
                                responsible for providing us with a written report of each inspection. The field
                                superintendents use this report to correct any defects prior to delivering the house to
                                the buyers.</p>

                                        placed correctly on the property.
